# unity-turtles
A Unity implementation of the board game turtles, but only half-finished

A small project I did on my spare time trying to make a Unity version of the board game Turtles. The game only supports one player, but has all the mechanics when it comes to cards and turtles. First player-owned turtle to reach the goal tile wins!
